Adds a column to the pages table in WP Admin > Pages displaying the page template used.

== Description ==

I often need to know which page template is applied to which page. In some cases, it's a lot of pages.

I would have to go to the quick edit screen for each page and then check the template used and make a note of it for future reference. That takes too much time.

So instead I wrote this little plugin that adds the page template information in a new column of the table at WP Admin > Pages.
